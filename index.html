            sisters living

            there has been disticnited. <br> Have you any tension of that as a Muslim being the Ummat of Muhammad

        <h1 class="info"> Why should you donate for the people leaving so far from you?</h1>
        <br><br>
        <p class="cause">
            1.Our first Qibla is situated in Zerujalem in Palestine. It is a very important for us & it has so much
            significance in the last times of earth's lifetime. <br><br>
            2.You have now no fellings of it. BUt if it was khilafat you must have feelings of that. Because, we the
            muslims, have been divided . It is the main reason of our defeat. <br><br>
            3.Now, the age of modern science, we don't extend our hands when the other side , our brothers, are being
            oppressed. <br><br>
            4. Hazrat Umar Bin Khattab (R) when got the news of being conquested by the Kafir, he called Khalid Bin
            Walid to get ready for war. SubhanAllah.!!!! <br><br>
            5. WE can't do this but one thing we can do. This is Dua & donation for the brothers of the other side.
            <br><br>
            6. Allah doesn't need anyone to help those people but we can join the group of the people who got chance of
            being a media of Allah to conquer . <br><br>
