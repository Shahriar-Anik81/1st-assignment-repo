        <h1 class="info"> Why should you donate for the people leaving so far from you?</h1>
        <br><br>
        <p class="cause">
            1.Our first Qibla is situated in Zerujalem in Palestine. It is a very important for us & it has so much
            significance in the last times of earth's lifetime. <br><br>
            2.You have now no fellings of it. BUt if it was khilafat you must have feelings of that. Because, we the
            muslims, have been divided . It is the main reason of our defeat. <br><br>
            3.Now, the age of modern science, we don't extend our hands when the other side , our brothers, are being
            oppressed. <br><br>
            4. Hazrat Umar Bin Khattab (R) when got the news of being conquested by the Kafir, he called Khalid Bin
            Walid to get ready for war. SubhanAllah.!!!! <br><br>
            5. WE can't do this but one thing we can do. This is Dua & donation for the brothers of the other side.
            <br><br>
            6. Allah doesn't need anyone to help those people but we can join the group of the people who got chance of
            being a media of Allah to conquer . <br><br>
            7.The most burning question you can ask me is why you help those people who are not from your section. I
            mean you can say they are Shiya or Sunni. If the question has arised in you, kindly think about what I am
            telling bellow... <br><br>
            8.We belive Prophet Muhammad (S) all shiya or sunni.Prophet Muhammad (S) was not Sunni. He(S) gave us the
            sunnah. He(S) was not shiya but he had Hasan(R) & Hussain(R).He was not hanafi,malkeki,ohabi nor any of
            these. So, what was he(S)??? <br><br><br>
            <span class="muslim">He(S) was a Muslim</span>

            <h1 class="condition"> The condition in Palestine</h1>
            <p>Almost everyday there are heard the sound of bomb blusts.Israel and Palestine’s war once again took the
                lives of 240 innocent lives. A ceasefire was reported between Israel and Palestinian militant Hamas
                during the holy month of Ramadan, in May 2021. The identified deaths were Palestinians in the territory
                of Gaza.

                Israel and Hamas both claimed victory as none of them is ready to agree on the UN terms
                The 100-year-old issue isn’t likely to end in the upcoming years. It all started when Britain took
                control over Palestine after defeating the Ottoman Empire during World War I.


                The beginning of the war

                In 1947, the UN voted to split Palestine into two parts, Arab and Jewish States to make Jerusalem an
                International City. The Jewish leaders backed this decision but Arabs resisted this change. Unable to
                solve the conflict, British rulers and Jewish leaders created the “State of Israel” in 1948. Many
                Palestinians resisted this conception and War began.


                During high seasons, the hotels, which overlook Omar ibn al-Khattab Square, bustle with tourists booked
                in for a holiday or a religious occasion in the holy city.The two properties – the New Imperial, a
                40-room hotel run by the Palestinian Muslim Dajani family since 1949, and the neighbouring Petra Hotel,
                a large complex held by the Kirrish family for decades – are a stone’s throw away from the iconic Jaffa
                Gate.

                When the sun sets every night, a sense of calm drapes the quarter, drowning out the day’s noise and
                returning the buildings to a time of the ancient past.

                But Israeli soldiers stationed at the entrance of the now empty Petra Hotel for the past five months
                hint at something disconcerting.

                For nearly 20 years, the Greek Orthodox Church and the wider Palestinian populace have tried to
                challenge the radical Israeli settler group, Ateret Cohanim, from taking the properties through a covert
                sale agreed to in 2004.

                The hotels, along with a historic residential complex in the Muslim Quarter, were sold as part of a
                $1.8m deal signed by a Greek official who has since disappeared and been named “corrupt” and a “traitor”
                by the church and Jerusalem’s wider Christian community.

                While the battle over these properties has often been framed as a legal one, the church says the issue
                is political at heart, and involves the protection of the properties’ Palestinian and Christian
                identities.

                “What these Israeli settlers have been planning for Jaffa Gate is part of a wider strategy to weaken the
                Palestinian presence in Jerusalem,” Archbishop Atallah Hanna, head of the Greek Orthodox Church in
                Jerusalem, told Al Jazeera.

                “Taking over the properties is a violation of Palestinian rights and of Christian holy sites,” said
                Hanna. “We’ve a responsibility to challenge attempts to erase Jerusalem’s Palestinian identity and
                history,” he added.</p>
